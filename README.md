## Troubleshooting

If the countdown is much faster than expected, it's probably connected to a UI speed. It occurred at least with GrapheneOS. Other alternative android builds may be problematic as well.

### 1. Enable Developer mode
1. Tap on the "Settings" (gear icon) icon to open the setting on your Android device.
2. On the Android Settings screen, tap on "About phone" option (sometimes also "System" > "Advanced" > "About Phone").
3. Start tapping on the "Build number" option, and you will see a pop-up message that you are now "X" steps away from being a developer. Continue tapping on the 4. Build number option until you see a screen to Re-enter your password. Once you enter your device password, it will show a message at the bottom of the screen: You are now a developer.

### 2. Fix the UI-related bug
1. Go to the "Settings" -> "System" -> "Developer options".
2. Switch the "Window animation scale" and "Transition animation scale" from "Animation off" to "Animation scale 1x," then put them back to "Animation off."
